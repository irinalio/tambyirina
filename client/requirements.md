## Packages
framer-motion | Page transitions and complex animations for the configurator
canvas-confetti | Celebration effect on order success
lucide-react | Icons for the UI

## Notes
The configurator uses a simulated preview system since we don't have a real 3D engine yet.
Images will use Unsplash for the "fully personalized" examples.
Tailwind config needs to support the custom fonts defined in index.css.
